## Project Overview

This project was inspired by the **Swachh Bharat Mission**, which encourages cleanliness in communities. The Smart Dustbin is designed using **Arduino UNO** and is equipped with **ultrasonic sensors** to automatically open and close the lid, providing a contactless waste disposal solution. The project aims to reduce the risk of disease, maintain hygiene, and improve the waste management process in urban areas.

### Objectives:
- Design a smart system that helps manage garbage collection more efficiently.
- Automate the opening and closing of the dustbin lid using sensors.
- Provide an affordable solution that can be used by communities.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of an object (garbage) and opens the lid.
- **Contactless Operation**: The system operates automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Alert System**: A buzzer alerts the user when the bin is full.
- **Energy Efficient**: Low power consumption hardware ensures the system is efficient.
- **IoT-based Monitoring**: In the future, IoT-based monitoring can be added for real-time status of bins.

## Technology Stack

### Hardware:
- **Arduino UNO**: Main microcontroller used for executing the code.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used for object detection to open and close the dustbin lid.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the opening and closing of the dustbin lid.
- **Buzzer**: Alerts when the dustbin is full.
- **Jumper Wires**: For connecting the components.

### Software:
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing and uploading code to the Arduino board.
- **C/C++**: Programming languages used for coding the logic.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. Servo Motor
4. Buzzer
5. Dustbin (for integration)
6. Jumper Wires

### Software:
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8 or later)

## How to Run the Project

1. **Download Arduino IDE**: Ensure you have the latest version of Arduino IDE installed.
2. **Install Necessary Libraries**: Ensure libraries like `Servo.h` are available in your Arduino IDE.
3. **Set Up Hardware**: Connect the components (Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, buzzer) as per the circuit diagram.
4. **Upload Code**: Upload the `main.ino` file to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.
5. **Power the System**: Once uploaded, connect the power supply to the Arduino.
6. **Test**: Place an object (garbage) near the sensor, and the lid will open. The buzzer will alert you once the bin is full.

## Project Outcomes

- **Automated Waste Management**: Reduced manual intervention for opening/closing the dustbin.
- **Increased Hygiene**: Contactless disposal promotes cleanliness and minimizes the spread of germs.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Low power consumption and affordable hardware make this a scalable solution for larger areas.

## Future Enhancements

- **Waste Segregation**: Introduce separate compartments for wet and dry waste.
- **IoT Integration**: Add an IoT system for real-time monitoring and data collection on waste levels.
- **Additional Sensors**: Add a sensor to detect when the bin is full and notify sanitation workers via a mobile app.
